#Note 1:
Linode is the cheapest cloud-hoster at this moment. This will be used to rent a GPU server, at which
the notebooks will be executed using the GPU of the server. This is way faster compared to using the CPU
at your local pc, which is also possible.

#Note 2:
When we have multiple GPU's, we can distribute the workload of the NN across the multiple GPU's, 
speeding up the process even more.

#Note 3:
You can't cross interact variables between CPU and GPU: when something is on the CPU, you can only access
variables on the CPU, same holds for the GPU.

#Note 4:
You should temporarely create a GPU server in the same region as the VPS. This minimizes transfer time
from
