Note 1:
datasets.utils.data.DataLoader(data,batch_size=10,shuffle=True), batch_size typically usefull for very large datasets,
in which Neural nets are most usefull. Also, using batches prevents overfitting. Shuffle helps generalizing the neural network,
thus preventing overfitting as well. 

Note 2:
For NN you generally want your datasets to be as balanced as possible. If 60% is 3's, the NN will probably learn the 
quickest way to get good scores, is to always predict 3's. Getting out of this behavior might not be possible.
