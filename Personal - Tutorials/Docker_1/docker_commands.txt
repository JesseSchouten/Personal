Build docker image from Dockerfile file:
docker build -t [name] . 
[comments: . for location of docker file]

docker run -p 80:80 [name]

Problem with line above is that a file will be copied when creating the image, when file is changed, the image needs to be recreated. 
A solution is to link the file from the directory to the docker container.
docker run -p 80:80 -v /src:/var/www/html/ hello-world

alternative to docker build, docker run: docker_compose.yml file
Lets us define all services and configurations in a single file, one command spins up all containers we need.
docker-compose up

CLEAR ALL DOCKER IMAGES FROM HARD DRIVE:
