Note 1:
Regular packages like Numpy run on the CPU, whilst Pytorch allows for processing on GPU, which is much faster. This is typically usefull for Deep Learning applications.
(CPU is usefull for several large calculations, while GPU is usefull for a large number of small(; paralell) calculations, such as calculating weights in a Neural Network.)

Note 2:
CUDA is a paralell computing platform and API model created by Nvidia. It allows developers to use CUDA-enabled GPU for general 
processing, especially usefull for machine learning algorithms. It requires a NVIDIA GPU and a special stream processor driver.
For startin Pytorch, this is not particularly usefull, but it becomes important for larger projects, as it enables the usage
of particularly powerfull applications, significantly increasing algorithm speed.
