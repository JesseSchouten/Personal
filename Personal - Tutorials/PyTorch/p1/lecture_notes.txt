Note 1:
Regular packages like Numpy run on the CPU, whilst Pytorch allows for processing on GPU, which is much faster. This is typically usefull for Deep Learning applications.
(CPU is usefull for several large calculations, while GPU is usefull for a large number of small calculations, such as calculating weights in a Neural Network.)
