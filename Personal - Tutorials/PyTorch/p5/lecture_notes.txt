Note 1:
Conv nets are outperforming recurrent neural nets on sequential data recently.

Note 2:
Window is sometimes referred to as 'kernel'. 

Note 3: 
Conv nets first apply a convolution, after which pooling is done (often max. pooling). This essence is that an image
is drastically simplified, as well as finding appropriate features. 

Note 4:
We won't work with colors, this doesn't really help for this problem. Color adds a channel in the convnet.
